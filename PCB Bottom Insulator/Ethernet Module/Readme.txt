This design is a 3D printable sheet of plastic to fix under the Ethernet Module board. This will insulate the board's bottom-side electrical contacts from short circuits, if the board is accidentally placed on a conductive surface. A proper enclosure for the module will be added soon.

Attach the printed sheet with 4 1/4-inch 4-40 screws, and 4-40 nuts. A 1/16-inch spacer on each screw is recommended, to enforce a small gap between the plastic and the board.
