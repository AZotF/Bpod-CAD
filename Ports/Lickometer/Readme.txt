Lickometer_15ga is a revision for use with a drink tube cut from 15-gage hypodermic steel tubing. The original (retired) version used 16-gage tubing, making it impossible to directly fit both the tubing and the valve.
The 15ga file includes a 3D printable sheath to protect the sensors. A pocket in the sheath captures a 4-40 nut, which attaches to the end of a Thor Labs 6mm post.

We recommend printing on an Ultimaker 2+ printer with gray or black Colorfabb XT. Use kapton tape on the glass print bed to increase adhesion with XT. Use a Jet RSB nozzle (3DSolex) with the original Olsson block if on Ultimaker 2 original. Use the following slicer and material settings for best performance:

***Lickometer***

Slicer:
Nozzle: 0.4mm
Layer height: 0.1mm (Lickometer)
Support: Everywhere (will require careful removal)
Infill: 30%
Wall thickness: 1.2mm
Top/Bottom thickness: 1.6mm
Print speed: 35mm/s
Cooling: enabled, 5s layer time
Plate adhesion: Skirt

Material:
Extruder: 225C Bed: 70C Flow: 100% Fan: 50%

***Sheath/Mount***
Same as above, except:
Wall thickness: 0.4mm
Support: Touching Build Plate
Support Top Distance: 0.3mm

Be *very* careful not to break the sensor-covering area of the sheath when removing support material.
