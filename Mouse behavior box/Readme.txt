Instructions:
-Each Sketchup file has several groups.
-Groups that are flat sheets are to be laser cut from white acrylic of the same material width. The transparent group should be cut from transparent acrylic.
-Groups that are not flat sheets are to be 3D printed.

- v1: Top window, walls and floor are 3mm. Rubber feet press directly onto the 3D printed base.

- v2: Top window, walls and floor are 4.5mm. The base is laser-cut from 9mm acrylic. Removable 3D printed sleeves interface the rubber feet with the base. These are each held on by two 1/2" 4-40 screws and two 4-40 nuts.
