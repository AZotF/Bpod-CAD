Designed to be 3D printed from XT Copolyester using a 0.4mm extruder. 

This base mounts the Yumo E6B2-CWZ3E rotary encoder to a ThorLabs Imperial optical breadboard using 1/4"-40 socket cap screws. 

It is designed to mount the encoder to the edge of the breadboard, so that a large affixed wheel can extend below the breadboard surface.
